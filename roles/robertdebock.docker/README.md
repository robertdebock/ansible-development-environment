docker
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-docker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-docker)

Install and configure Docker on your system.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/default/playbook.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false

  roles:
    - robertdebock.bootstrap
    - robertdebock.epel
    - robertdebock.python_pip
    - robertdebock.docker

  tasks:
    - name: Create a container
      docker_container:
        name: openssh
        image: robertdebock/docker-centos-openssh
        ports:
          - "2222:22"
      when:
        - ansible_virtualization_type != "docker"

```

Role Variables
--------------

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for docker

# To update all packages installed by this roles, set `docker_package_state` to `latest`.
docker_package_state: present

# Some Docker containers do not allow managing services, rebooting and writing
# to some locations in /etc. The role skips tasks that will typically fail in
# Docker. With this parameter you can tell the role to -not- skip these tasks.
docker_ignore_docker: yes

```

Requirements
------------

- Access to a repository containing packages, likely on the internet.
- A recent version of Ansible. (Tests run on the last 3 release of Ansible.)

The following roles can be installed to ensure all requirements are met, using `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml`:

```yaml
---
- robertdebock.bootstrap
- robertdebock.epel
- robertdebock.python_pip

```
