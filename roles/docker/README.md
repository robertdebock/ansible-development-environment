Install and configure Docker (non-CE) on your system.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/resources/playbook.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - robertdebock.docker

  tasks:
    - name: Create a container
      docker_container:
        name: openssh
        image: robertdebock/docker-centos-openssh
        ports:
          - "2222:22"
      when:
        - ansible_virtualization_type != "docker"
```

The machine you are running this on, may need to be prepared, I use this playbook to ensure everything is in place to let the role work.
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
    - robertdebock.bootstrap
    - robertdebock.core_dependencies
    - robertdebock.buildtools
    - robertdebock.epel
    - robertdebock.python_pip
```

Testing
-------

[Unit tests](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-docker) are done on every commit, pull request, release and periodically.

If you find issues, please register them in [GitHub](https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-docker/issues)

Testing is done using [Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule):

[Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) tests multiple ansible versions.
[Molecule](https://github.com/ansible/molecule) tests multiple distributions.

To test using the defaults (any installed ansible version, namespace: `robertdebock`, image: `fedora`, tag: `latest`):

```
molecule test

# Or select a specific image:
image=ubuntu molecule test
# Or select a specific image and a specific tag:
image="debian" tag="stable" tox
```

Or you can test multiple versions of Ansible, and select images:
Tox allows multiple versions of Ansible to be tested. To run the default (namespace: `robertdebock`, image: `fedora`, tag: `latest`) tests:

```
tox

# To run CentOS (namespace: `robertdebock`, tag: `latest`)
image="centos" tox
# Or customize more:
image="debian" tag="stable" tox
```
