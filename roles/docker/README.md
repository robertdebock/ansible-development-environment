docker
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-docker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-docker)

Install and configure Docker (non-CE) on your system.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/default/playbook.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - robertdebock.docker

  tasks:
    - name: Create a container
      docker_container:
        name: openssh
        image: robertdebock/docker-centos-openssh
        ports:
          - "2222:22"
      when:
        - ansible_virtualization_type != "docker"
```

The machine you are running this on, may need to be prepared. Tests have been done on machines prepared by this playbook:
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no

  roles:
    - robertdebock.bootstrap
    - robertdebock.epel
    - robertdebock.python_pip
```
