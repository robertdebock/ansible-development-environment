Install and configure git on your system.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/default/playbook.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: false
  become: true

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.bootstrap
    - role: robertdebock.git

```

Also see a [full explanation and example](https://robertdebock.nl/how-to-use-these-roles.html) on how to use these roles.

Role Variables
--------------

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for git

# The system username in /home where to place the gitconfig file.
git_username: johndoe

# The group to own directories.
git_groupname: "{{ git_username }}"

# Settings for git configuration.
git_user_email: johndoe@example.com
git_user_name: John Doe

# Where to place the copies of the repositories.
git_repository_destination: /home/{{ git_username }}/Documents/github.com/{{ git_username }}

# The repositories to check out, bootstrap is pinned to a version, java will get HEAD/latest.
# git_repositories:
#   - repo: https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-bootstrap.git
#     dest: bootstrap
#     version: 2.2.4
#   - repo: ssh://git@github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-java.git
