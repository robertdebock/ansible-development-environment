## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/resources/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  vars:
    git_username: root
    git_groupname: root
    git_repository_destination: /root
    git_repositories:
      - repo: https://github.com/robertdebock/robertdebock.bootstrap
        dest: bootstrap
      - repo: https://github.com/robertdebock/robertdebock.bootstrap
        dest: bootstrap-force
        force: yes
      - repo: https://github.com/robertdebock/robertdebock.bootstrap
        dest: bootstrap-version
        version: 2.11.1

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.git
```

The machine needs to be prepared in CI this is done using `molecule/resources/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes
  serial: 30%

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.bootstrap
```

Also see a [full explanation and example](https://robertdebock.nl/how-to-use-these-roles.html) on how to use these roles.

## [Role Variables](#role-variables)

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml

# defaults file for git

# The system username in /home where to place the gitconfig file.
# git_username: johndoe

# The group to own directories.
# git_groupname: "{{ git_username }}"

# Settings for git configuration.
# git_user_email: johndoe@example.com
# git_user_name: John Doe

# Where to place the copies of the repositories.
git_repository_destination: /home/{{ git_username | default('unset') }}/Documents/github.com/{{ git_username | default('unset') }}

# Should git force (overwrite locally changed) clone? (Can also be controlled
# per repository, see below.
git_force: no

# The repositories to check out, bootstrap is pinned to a version, java will get HEAD/latest.
