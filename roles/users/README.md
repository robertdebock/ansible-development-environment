## [Example Playbook](#example-playbook)

This example is taken from `molecule/default/converge.yml` and is tested on each push, pull request and release.

            - "ALL= NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl stop httpd"
```

The machine needs to be prepared. In CI this is done using `molecule/default/prepare.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.bootstrap
    - role: robertdebock.core_dependencies

  tasks:
    - name: Set authorized keys for root
      ansible.posix.authorized_key:
        user: root
        state: present
        key: "ssh-rsa XYZYX54321"
```
